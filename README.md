# cheese-shop-script
This is pretty much just a monty python python script script. So a script, written in python based on the script to a sketch of monty python. The infamous cheese shop to be more precise. What it does is very simple, just asks for a kind of cheese and gives you the same respond as the owner of monty python's cheese shop.

Found the transcript here. http://www.montypython.net/scripts/cheese.php
A reddit post that I made back when I made the first version of the script. I was just starting out in python and it is a complete mess.

The new version is bit more elegant tho.

##Disclaimer

I of course do not own any rights to the content of monty python's sketch. This is just intended as a fun little "project" that hopefully some people will find as funny as I did.
